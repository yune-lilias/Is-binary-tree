# Is-binary-tree
difficulty: simple
Check if a series of number (divided by space) can be a balanced binary tree 
Data Structure assignment

In this problem, you will be given a binary tree represented asan array.  
Your job will be to verify if it is a binary search tree or not.
Input will be given as a space-separated array representing a binary treeas we discussed in class, 
with the root node occupying the 0th index, the root node's children occupying indices 1 and 2, 
their children occupyingindices 3-6, etc.  All trees will be balanced, and will be filled left to right in the bottom layer

Restriction: run time must be O(n)
             no additional import libraries
